# vue-headless-combobox

A headless ComboBox Vue.js component that is fully accessible.

Inspired from [WAI-ARIA ComboBox example](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/combobox/combobox-autocomplete-list.html).

You have complete control of whether the suggestions should be open, if you have the need to use an API for searching, or accepting the value being selected.

## Installation

```
# npm
npm install vue-headless-combobox

# Yarn
yarn add vue-headless-combobox
```

## Example

Check out the simple example application in the `dev` folder. [Link](./dev/App.vue).

The App is also hosted at CodePen. [Link](https://codepen.io/captainskippah/pen/rNwYWWw).
